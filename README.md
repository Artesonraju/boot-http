# boot-http

A simple HTTP `serve` task for use with [the boot build tool][boot]
that can serve resources, directories or a typical ring handler.


## Usage

(The following examples assume you have [boot installed][installboot] and updated.)

### Command line, no setup

This serves the **current directory** at port **3000**:

```bash
boot -d pandeiro/boot-http serve -d . wait
```

To inspect the meanings of the flags and other tasks, use boot's built-in
documentation mechanism:

```bash
boot -d pandeiro/boot-http -h       # show all tasks on the classpath
boot -d pandeiro/boot-http serve -h # show serve's usage
```

### Within a project

If you already have a `build.boot`, add `[pandeiro/boot-http "0.4.0"]` to `:dependencies` and
`(require '[pandeiro.http :refer :all])`. Then the command is shorter, e.g.:

```bash
boot serve -d target wait
```

That would serve the `target` directory if it exists. Instead of specifying a directory,
you can also specify a ring handler:

```bash
boot serve -H myapp.server/app wait
```

### Composability

You may have noticed the `wait` task being used after all the invocations so far. This is
because by itself, the `serve` task does not block and exits immediately.

What good is that? It means you can compose with other tasks.

In [boot-cljs-example][boot-cljs-example], for example, `serve` is
invoked like so:

```bash
boot serve -d target/ watch speak reload cljs-repl cljs -usO none
```

In that case, since serve is given a directory, it serves the directory and whatever
resources can be found on the classpath, and then gets out of the way.

### Other options

You can set the port to serve on, too:

```bash
boot -d pandeiro/http serve -d . -p 8888 wait
```


## API and Roadmap

Right now that is about it. It basically blends the functionality of `python3 -m http.server` and
a subset of `lein ring server`.

Feel free to add issues or comment [here][boot-discourse] if
you have any ideas.
